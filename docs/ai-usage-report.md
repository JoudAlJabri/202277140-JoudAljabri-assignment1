# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### Claude Code
- **Use case**: CSS code generation and JavaScript guidance
- **How it was used**: Claude Code was used to generate portions of the CSS styling, including layout structure, responsive media queries, and the dark/light theme variable system. It was also used for guidance on implementing JavaScript functions such as the theme toggle with localStorage, form submission handling, and scroll-based animations using the Intersection Observer API.

### Google Gemini
- **Use case**: Documentation preferences and organization
- **How it was used**: Gemini was used to help organize and structure the project documentation, including the README layout and the technical documentation file. It provided suggestions on how to present information clearly and in a well-organized format.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
- **Faster CSS development**: Writing extensive CSS for responsive layouts, animations, and theme support is time-consuming. AI assistance accelerated this process significantly, allowing more time to focus on understanding the concepts rather than writing boilerplate.
- **Learning new APIs**: Claude Code provided guidance on using the Intersection Observer API for scroll animations, which was a new concept. The explanations alongside the code helped build understanding.
- **Better documentation structure**: Gemini helped produce well-organized documentation that follows standard conventions, making the project easier to understand for others.

### Challenges
- **Context limitations**: AI sometimes generated CSS that didn't perfectly match the intended design, requiring manual adjustments to colors, spacing, and breakpoints.
- **Over-engineering**: Some AI suggestions were more complex than necessary for the assignment scope and had to be simplified.
- **Verification needed**: All generated code had to be tested and verified to ensure it worked correctly across different screen sizes and browsers.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained a deeper understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox by reviewing and modifying AI-generated layout code.
- Learned how CSS custom properties (variables) work for implementing theme switching.
- Understood the Intersection Observer API for creating scroll-triggered animations.
- Improved documentation skills by learning how to structure technical writing effectively.
- Developed a workflow of using AI as a starting point, then reviewing and customizing the output to match specific requirements.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI-generated code was carefully reviewed and modified before being included in the project:

- **CSS**: AI-generated styles were used as a foundation, but colors, spacing values, font sizes, and responsive breakpoints were adjusted to match the intended design. Unused styles were removed to keep the code clean.
- **JavaScript**: AI provided guidance on function structure and API usage (e.g., `localStorage`, `IntersectionObserver`). The actual implementation was written with understanding of each line's purpose, and variable names and logic flow were customized.
- **Documentation**: AI-suggested structures were adapted to accurately reflect the project's actual content and the specific work done.
